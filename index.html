    <h1>Merry Christmas 🎄</h1>
    <p>
      May your Christmas be wrapped in warmth—the kind that settles gently in your heart and makes everything feel safe and beautiful.
May soft lights glow around you, not just on trees and streets, but in the little moments that make you smile without realizing it.
May every cozy second slow time down, so you can breathe, laugh, and feel truly loved.

I hope this Christmas brings you peace in quiet moments, joy in unexpected ones, and memories so beautiful they stay with you long after the season fades.
The kind of memories that feel like comfort on hard days and happiness on ordinary ones.

And wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, I hope you feel how special you are—today, this Christmas, and always. 💫❤️
